I've always loved working with support along with supporting it, hence my current role as an application support analyst. I love the concept of fixing software issues, now, I'm on the other side where I'm creating software applications and using raw data to answer business questions and provide upstream data. While supporting software I had a chance to play around in a live sandbox where I had access to SQL tables. I was curious on how queries produced particular results. This led me on a journey of performing simple queries and gaining insight into the power of databases.

Further into my journey of supporting software, I became interested in exploring how data was being provided to power applications. I then began to learn backend engineering and how databases connected and powered front end applications. With the addition of attending a full stack boot camp, I was continuously exploring building full stack websites and understanding what each tool in a stack was responsible for.

Currently, I'm still peeking into databases and now learning how to manipulate the data to answer business questions and building supporting data pipelines to provide continuous data. I've worked on various ETL and Warehouse projects and now attending data talk club Data Engineering Zoomcamp to pursue a data engineering career that I'll document on a weekly basis.
